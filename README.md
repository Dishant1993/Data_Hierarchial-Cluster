Hierarchial Cluster
# Strategy to group Engineering Colleges

Problem Satement: An independent trainer who would like to pitch your Data Science training program to a set of Engineering colleges. 
You have data of 26 colleges after survey using questionnaires. 
Each college has been given a score for 5 performance criteria-Teaching, Fees, Placement, Internship & Infrastructure.
Ratings are in the standardized scale of 1 to 5 where 5 has a higher weightage than 1. 
Segment the colleges into groups and come up with your pitch recommendations for each segment

Created three clusters through average linkage method
Cluster 1: Tier 1 colleges (Top Colleges)
Cluster 2: Tier 3 colleges (Poor performing colleges/new college)
Cluster 3: Tier 2 colleges (Medium performing colleges)

Recommendations:
For companies hiring, go to colleges for Placements are Tier 1 colleges, followed by Tier 2 colleges
For companies providing Training program to staffs and students, go to colleges are Tier 2 and Tier 3 Colleges, since Tier 1 is comparitively performing better.
Tier 3 colleges will need to concentrate more on Marketing and Advertisements about their campus to create awareness and attract students
Students looking to enroll in a college, can give priority to Tier 1 over Tier 2 and 3 colleges
